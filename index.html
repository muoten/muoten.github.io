            <p> <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> are only a (generally small and biased) subsample of actual infections.

              How small and how biased?
              It depends on the <strong>testing</strong> resources and protocols applied in each country/region.
            </p>

          <p>
            How many people could be actually infected all around?
            Estimations have been done by different models and analysts.
            For instance, the following values have been reported by the
            <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-04-03-COVID19-Report-14.pdf">
              Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team
            <img src="img/imperial_college_estimates.png"  alt="Estimates by Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team">
          </a>
        </p>
          <p>
          According to this model, Spain could have around 15% of infected population as of March 28th.
          But the 95% credible interval provided was between 3.7% and 41%. So the <strong>uncertainty</strong> is still huge!
          However, even the lower bound of the estimation corresponded to almost 2 million people.
          Almost 30 times higher than the number of confirmed cases in Spain at that date (72K).
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kikollan">Kiko Llaneras</a> et al also published at

          </a>
          4 different calculations, from different researchers and models, ranging from 150K to 900K expected infections
          in Spain at March 24th. When confirmed cases were below 40K according to Spanish government.

          While the estimations of Imperial College have been broadly communicated in mass media, often ignoring
          the main <strong>assumptions</strong> and confidence intervals underlying the gross numbers,
          I think data team at <i>elpais.com</i>, and specially Llaneras is doing a god job on communicating the numbers
          but also contextualizing assumptions under these numbers.
        </p>
            <p>
              Anyhow, numbers from confirmed cases and notified deaths per country, and alternative
              <strong>estimates</strong> of actual infections and deaths
              infered by different studies and models
              should be understood under their <strong>context</strong>.
              Language should be used rigourously to avoid <i>misinformation</i>.

              <p>
                Moreover the number of confirmed and notified deaths is also an estimation of actual deaths caused by the virus.
                And specially in some countries/regions this value could be highly underestimated.
                Statistics on mortality monitoring on all causes, as project <a href="https://www.euromomo.eu">EuroMomo</a> does,
                can be useful to infer alternative (and better) estimates based on excess mortality.
                This project was launched in 2008 and it uses data from a network of 29 partner Institutes from 26 countries.
                They have accessible maps with weekly estimated deviations from the baseline
                (<a href="https://www.euromomo.eu/outputs/images/z-score_lightbox.fw.png">z-scores</a>)
                 from week 1 of 2010 up until today. And charts with disaggregated <a href="https://www.euromomo.eu/outputs/zscore_country_total.html">
                data by country and age range</a> for the past 4½ years.

              <p>Despite the dramatic situation in many places, differences are still huge even for regions in the same country.
                For instance, the following charts belong to the
                <a href="https://www.isciii.es/QueHacemos/Servicios/VigilanciaSaludPublicaRENAVE/EnfermedadesTransmisibles/MoMo/Documents/informesMoMo2020/MoMo_Situacion%20a%202%20de%20abril_CNE.pdf">

              </a>
              </p>
              <p>
                We can observe excess mortality has been yet dramatically huge in the second figure representing the Region of Madrid.

                 However the third figure represents Canary Islands, where the first case in Spain was diagnosed.
                 And it shows the impact on mortality in this region has been much lower.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fortunately, after the hard confinement measures decreed by the Spanish Government,
                both regions have current estimations of Basic Reproduction Number (R0) at April 7th near or under 1.
                According to official
                <a href="https://portalcne.isciii.es/covid19/">estimates by the Spanish Ministry of Healthcare</a>,
                R0 estimates would be 0.99 for Madrid and 0.71 for the Canary Islands.
              </p>

              <p>MoMo project in Spain collects information of aproximately 4K civil registers,
                with a coverage of the 92% of the Spanish population. Estimates of expected mortality are based
                on historical averages of observed mortality since January 1th 2008 until one year before the current date.
                This information has been published in reports in PDF format. Buth they have recently developed also an
                <a href="https://momo.isciii.es/public/momo/dashboard/momo_dashboard.html">interactive dashboard</a>
                with access to historical <a href="https://momo.isciii.es/public/momo/dashboard/momo_dashboard.html#datos">
                  data in CSV</a> for the last 2 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next figure published by <a href="https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020/04/09/actualidad/1586435286_092135.html">elpais</a>
                presents both the number of deaths registered by MoMo and deaths confirmed with COVID-19 until April 2th in
                the 17 regional autonomies of Spain.
              </p>
              <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVOt6YQU8AA2abE?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="Deaths registered by MoMo vs deaths confirmed with COVID-19 in Spain">
<p>
  Despite this chart doesn't show the excess mortality estimates by MoMo, but the total number of deaths, we can
  see that confirmed COVID-19 deaths at april 2th in Madrid or Catalunya are even higher than the total number
  of deaths registered in these regions until April 7th. Whereas in Castilla y León and Castilla La Mancha,
  where high ratios of excess mortality have been detected, the reported COVID-19 deaths have been significantly lower.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Due to the <strong>latency</strong> in collecting this kind of data conclusions have to be read with <strong>caution</strong></i>.
  In some regions latency on notification would be higher than usual due to saturated Civil Registers.
Curiously, the excess mortality estimated by MoMo at April 5th (12940) approximates a lot the 12418 COVID-19
confirmed deaths at country level at the same date.
<!--If this trend consolidates, one possible hypothesis for underestimates and overestimates at region level
could be related with interregional demographics. Maybe many residents in Madrid originary from Castilla y Leon and Castilla La Mancha could have been registered
  as deaths in their regions of birth.-->

              <p>
                It seems that COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) could be less lethal in relative terms than current figures we get in Italy or Spain
                (<i>estimated deaths/estimated infections</i> would be lower than <i>confirmed deaths/confirmed cases</i>).
                Though much more contagious than we expected. So <i>much more lethal in absolute terms</i>.
                With the aggravating circumstance of saturating healthcare systems
                and increasing even more the number of direct and indirect deaths caused.
              </p>
              <!--<p>
                Both confirmed cases and notified deaths have limitations,
                specially when read on a static basis they don't reveal the actual magnitude of the disease.
                Though, while the protocols don't change for a given series of data,
                they allow to follow trends and monitor the exponential/geometrical growth.

                April 4th report by CCAES</a> (Center of Alert Coordination and Healthcare Emergencies),

                <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000044">Wu P. et al

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Spain vs Germany (updated 26-04-2020)</div>

          <p>The number of confirmed cases in Germany at April 26th is around 157K people, whereas there are around 226K confirmed cases in Spain
            (<a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85320e2ea5424dfaaa75ae62e5c06e61">Johns Hopkins University</a>,
            <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">worldometer</a>). But relative lethality estimates by COVID-19 on Germany seems below 4% (<i>confirmed deaths / confirmed cases</i>). Much lower than figures in Spain (10%)
            or Italy (13%).
          </p>
          <p>

            There are several aspects than could explain this big difference.
            But I will focus on the representativity of the sample of confirmed tests in relation to the overall population.
            If we compare the distribution of confirmed cases by age groups in Spain and Germany we can see that:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
            In Spain confirmed cases are biased to ranges of older people. While young people would be underrepresented.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Germany we have just the opposite effect. Though their distribution of confirmed cases is more similar to the overall distribution, people from 60 to 79 would be slightly underrepresented, while age group of 35 to 59 would be overrepresented among confirmed cases.
          </li>
        </ul>

            At the begining of the crisis South Korea was the country with a higher number of tests performed
            and a more representative sample in terms of age distribution. Currently,
            according to Our World in Data, Iceland has performed much more tests per capita.
            Furthermore is a reference on <a href="https://www.covid.is/english">data transparency</a>.

            According to the number of confirmed cases and deaths with COVID-19 on Iceland,
            relative lethality for those tested positive could be below 1%.
            Actually at the time of writing is only around 0.5% in that country.
            Moreover, data from Iceland is helping to get more educated guesses on the proportion of asymptomatic infected people.
            Estimates published on April 14th on <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100">Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic Population</a>,
            report that "43% of the participants who tested positive reported having no symptoms, although symptoms almost certainly developed later in some of them.".
            Though these estimations have to be read also with caution as the effect of false positives should be taked into account.

            <i>SEIR (Susceptible → Exposed → Infected → Removed)</i> [<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext">Wu, et. al</a>, Kucharski et. al].
            The model uses 13 parameters, including <i>Mortality statistics</i> and the <i>Basic Reproduction Number (R0)</i> before and after the <i>Intervention</i> day.
</p>
<p>
I tried to adjust the evolution of confirmed deaths (<i>Fatalities</i>) in the Region of Madrid since the day this number was over N=10.
Displacing <i>Intervention</i> day relatively to this reference. And ignoring the <i>Day 0</i> as time origin.
<!--I expect that following trends of confirmed fatalities would propagate less uncertainty
and provide more reliable estimates than starting from the first confirmed case.-->

  <p> Concretely, the number of reported deaths on the Region of Madrid at 14th March, when the Spanish Government decreeted
    the state of Alarm, was 213. While only 7 days before, the number was 16. And 3 weeks later this number increased from 213 to
    5136, according to <a href="https://covid19.isciii.es/resources/serie_historica_acumulados.csv">covid19.iscii.es data</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I used 1% as <i>Mortality Statistics</i> and 10 days for <i>T<small>inf</small> (Duration patient is infectious)</i>.
    And in order to fit the evolution of confirmed deaths R0 was established to 3.9 before the intervention
    and 1.0 after the intervention.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think the model is useful to have an idea of the interconnected variables and effects.
    <!--And trying to fit the different parameters according to the last knowledge available.-->
    But results from this model should be read with caution.
    Moreover, appart from the uncertainty introduced by many different estimated parameters and hidden variables,
    this implementation of SEIR ignores the effect of the healthcare capacity system,
    and the possibility on mortality increase due to ICU bed shortage.

            <p>Could you get into a berlin exclusive nightclub?
              <strong>Berlout</strong> tells users if they fit the admission criteria for Berlin clubs:
              dark clothes, no jeans, no more than 3 people, around 30s, no laughing, no drinks...

              You only have to take a picture.
              And <i>computer vision</i> algorithm identifies elements related with your probability of being rejected.
              You will see what clubs you could enter with more chances according to this evaluation.
