            <p>
              Sometimes we can feel we know the basics and it's time to move on to something else.
             If <strong>gradient boosted trees are good enough to fit my tabular data</strong>,
               but xgboost implementation seems not efficient and accurate enough to my needs, I could try lightgbm or catboost.
               Moreover, all of these algorithm implementations deal
              reasonable well even with unbalanced datasets and colinearity. So <strong>why should I care about</strong> simpler (and older) <strong>regression models?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              It's very healthy to never stop learning, and questioning ourselves everything. But, since a pragmatic and utilitaristic point of view...
              is it really worth the time to review the fundamentals of linear and logistic regression
              in details?
            </p>

            <p>
              My opinion is that it's not crucial to know implementation details of algorithms to get reasonable accurate predictions
              on your validation and test sets, but... accurate predictions, out of Kaggle, many times are not the main point.
              And our search for "accuracy" often hides the requirement of generating <strong>actionable knowledge</strong>,
              that is, getting insights to make useful interventions in the <i>real world</i>.
              For this purpose it's preferable to understand our problem in terms of <strong>associations and causality</strong>.
              And be prepared to answer <i>"what if"</i> questions?
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus... <i>what if</i> I tried to infer causal knowledge about a particular problem by using simple regressions?
          </p>

          <br/><h4>Life expectancy vs Health expenditure: Linear Regression models for Longitudinal data.</h4>

          <blockquote style='display: block;margin-top: 1em;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 40px;margin-right: 40px; border:1px; content: open-quote;'>
            <p><i>Sometimes...You can't see the forest for the (Gradient Boosted) trees</i></p></blockquote>
          <p>
            After realizing I could have not really understand some benefits and relevant aspects of linear models because of the great advantages of
            <i>xgboost</i> I tried to compare different linear regression implementations.
            My goal was to model the main variables that affect <strong>life expectancy</strong>.
            And trying to isolate the effect of multiple collinearities and interdependences expected between the different explanatory variables.
          </p>
          <p>As this goal was quite ambitious I started by using only
          the <strong>health expenditure</strong> per capita as explanatory variable. For this purpose
            I obtained the data from the <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database/Home/IndicatorsDownload/en">
              WHO's Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED)</a>.
              Source for Life Expectancy estimates was <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?time=..&country=~OWID_WRL">
                OurWorldInData</a>. More details in my <a href="https://github.com/muoten/life-expectancy/blob/master/life_expectancy_vs_health_expenditure_linear_regression.ipynb">
                  Jupyter Notebook on github</a>.
          </p>
          <figure>
          <img src="img/health_expenditure_and_life_expectancy.png"
          alt="Health Expenditure and Life Expectancy" style="border:1px solid black;width:70%;margin:auto;display:block">
          <figcaption style="text-align:center"><small>Source: <a href="https://github.com/muoten/life-expectancy/blob/master/life_expectancy_vs_health_expenditure_linear_regression.ipynb">
            muoten.github.io</a>. With data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?time=..&country=~OWID_WRL">
            OurWorldIndata</a> and <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database/Home/IndicatorsDownload/en">

          </small>

          </figure>
          <br/>

            <p>
              Both datasets correspond to multi-dimensional data involving "measurements"
              over time. This kind of data is usually referred in statistics and econometrics,
              as <strong>longitudinal</strong> or also <strong>panel data</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>In Python there are at least 3 different packages we could use to apply linear models to our data.
              So I've compared the implementations of the following:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li><pre>scikitlearn</pre></li>
                <li><pre>statsmodels</pre></li>
                <li><pre>linearmodels</pre></li>
              </ul>

            <p>First of all, after preparing and exploring the data, I decide to transform Health Expenditure variable by applying the natural logarithm.
            </p>
            <figure>
            <img src="img/life_expectancy_and_health_expenditure_log.png"

            </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br/>
            <p>Finally we can compare the different implementations of Ordinary Least Squares.
              In the next figures, the statsmodel implementation, with a constant term (the intercept).
              Resulting in a coefficient value (beta) of <math><mn>4,32</mn></math> for the explanatory variable, with standard error of <math><mn>0,33</mn></math>.
              Assuming that <i>the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified</i>, as indicated in the output.

            <p>According to our simple model the life expectancy for Spain in 2017 could be roughly estimated as
              <math><mn>79.6</mn></math><math><mo>&PlusMinus;</mo><mn>0.8</mn></math> years.
           <!--(<math><mrow><mo>=</mo>46.0 <mo>+</mo> 4.3<mo>·</mo>log(2500)</mrow></math>).
              Assuming standard errors in the margin of <math>+-0.8</math>.
            -->
              Actually life expectancy in Spain is even higher,
              as it is one of the highest in the world. Concretely, the value in our dataset for 2017 was <math><mn>83.3</mn></math> years.
              Anyway not so bad taking into account that is a single variable simple model.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, in the notebook they are more details about the Coefficient of Determination calculation,
              or the relation and differences between different configurations of Linear Regression models for longitudinal (panel) data.
              Finally this first analysis have limited to Ordinary Least Squares,
              with <a href="http://statmath.wu.ac.at/~hauser/LVs/FinEtricsQF/FEtrics_Chp5.pdf">Fixed Effect and Random Effect variants</a>,
                supported by

                linearmodels package.</a>, with the names of PanelOLS and RandomEffects, respectively.
              Other alternatives, as Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularizations have been excluded from the scope, at the moment.
          </p>

          <h4>Linear regression. Recycling the residuals</h4>
          <p>
            The residuals in a linear regression model are the differences between the estimates and the true values.
            Besides to optimize them in order to be as small as possible, it's important to check these residuals are independent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Non random patterns in the residuals reveal our model is not good enough.
            Further, in the OLS context, random errors are assumed to produce residuals that are
            normally distributed and centered in zero. Moreover, the residuals should not be correlated with another variable, and adjacent residuals should not be correlated with each other (autocorrelation)
    <a href="https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/why-you-need-to-check-your-residual-plots-for-regression-analysis">
    Reference</a>
            </p>

              The python package <a href="https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/regressor/residuals.html">

                By plotting the residuals for the Life Expectancy vs Health Expenditure (log) LinearRegression Model of the previous example
                we can see there is indeed a pattern.

            <h4>Regression by dependence minimization. And causal discovery</h4>
            <p>
              After reading
            <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwicpOi5v_rqAhVFC2MBHfD6BvgQFjABegQIBBAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fis.tuebingen.mpg.de%2Ffileadmin%2Fuser_upload%2Ffiles%2Fpublications%2FICML2009-Mooij_%5B0%5D.pdf">
              "Regression by dependence minimization and its application to causal inference in additive noise models"</a>
              by Mooij et al, even simple regression models seem less uncool.
              And looking into the residuals becomes even more interesting.
            </p>
            <p>Anyhow, we have to be cautious, as Judea Pearl says, no matter how sophisticated an algorithm is,
              you can not infer causality by only looking to the data. Some previous assumptions are required.
              Application of this "cool" algorithms don't get results for free. To move Data Science from

          <p>

          On 13/05/2020, <a href="https://www.mscbs.gob.es/ciudadanos/ene-covid/docs/ESTUDIO_ENE-COVID19_PRIMERA_RONDA_INFORME_PRELIMINAR.pdf">
            preliminary results</a> of Spain's seroprevalence study ENECOVID were published presenting first estimates of <strong>5% of prevalence</strong>
            of IgG antibodies for SARS-Cov2, estimating a range of uncertainty between 4.7% and 5.4% (IC 95%).
          Considering a population of 47 millions, approximately 2.3 million people would have developed antibodies.
            Same day, COVID-19 confirmed cases on Spain (<i>PCR+</i>) were 229540.
            So the <strong>estimated</strong> number of <strong>infections</strong> occured in Spain could be <strong>10 times higher</strong> than <strong>confirmed cases.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Anyway report warns these results have to be considered <strong>provisional</strong> as they don't include yet complete information on immunoassays.
          So these estimates have to be read with caution.

          <p>
          In summary, for this <i>serosurvey</i> approximately 60000 participants were recruited. Actually 60983 from a list of 81613, as 14549 refused to participate.
          The study observes "remarkable <strong>geographic variability</strong>".
          Concretely, prevalence estimates at province level range from a maximum of 14.2% for the province of Soria to a minimum of 1.1% for the autonomous city of Ceuta, 1.4% for Las Palmas (Canary Islands) and 1.4% the Region of Murcia.
</p>
<p>
          Moreover, Madrid with 11% and other inland and closer provinces from Castilla Leon (the mentioned Soria and also Segovia) and Castilla La Mancha complete the list of regions with higher estimated prevalence.
          Whereas the higher value for coastal provinces is for Barcelona with 7%. Then Malaga with 4%, Bizkaia 3.9% and neighbouring Cantabria 3.2%.
          While all the other coastal 18 provinces are below 3% threshold, including also Canary Islands and Baleares.
        </p>
<br/>
          <p>
          My <i><u>opinion</u></i>  based on the report:
        <i>&lt;personal_bias_alert&gt;</i>
          sample size is large and the information seems very interesting.
          Though results are preliminary and should be considered vith some caution. They will be very useful to provide the basis for better-informed policies and actions.
          As long as they consolidate in the next weeks with the immunoassay data.
          Detail of methodology to be used is explained in Annex 3 of the <a href="https://portalcne.isciii.es/enecovid19/documentos/ene_covid19_dis.pdf">study design</a> (in Spanish).
        </p>
        <p>
          However it's a pity that these preliminary results are presented only in PDF, and they don't include raw data in CSV.
          Transparency but also <strong>data accesibility</strong> should not be considered a luxury. Whereas they don't conflict with other legal or ethical issues.
          Two heads are better than one. But maybe I'm just an idealistic of open source, open science and <strong>reproducible research</strong>.
        <i>&lt;/personal_bias_alert&gt;</i>
      </p>
        <p>
          Anyway... my two cents with some particular open questions, links and <strong>context</strong> regarding the methodology and the results.
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li>
           Questions on methodology:
           <ul>
               <li>could be some unadjusted measure or misclasification bias? More details in <a href="#covid19-seroprevalence-bias">next section</a></li>
               <li>could be some kind of unadjusted selection bias?</li>
           </ul>
         </li>

          <li>
          Questions on geographic variability. Some patterns seems to emerge. Can we estimate the influence of the following interrelated aspects?
          <ul>
            <li>
              population density

        <h4 id="covid19-seroprevalence-bias">Test error estimates and (my) simplified bias analysis on ENECOVID preliminary results</h4>
         <h6>(21/05/2020, Work in progress)</h6>
        <p>
          Tests used to detect antibodies, as other kind of clinical measures don't have to be perfect to be useful.
          Generally 2 characteristics define this kind of imperfections: <strong>specificity</strong> (true negative rate) and <strong>sensitivity</strong> (true positive rate or <i>recall</i>).
          Let's say, they relate to the ability to avoid
          <strong>false positives</strong> and <strong>false negatives</strong> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two kind of errors are also known in statistics as <i>type 1</i> and <i>type 2</i> errors.
          And there is often some unbalance between their corresponding error rates.
          For clinical diagnoses these unbalance can be even desirable, as both type of errors don't have in general the same impact.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m not sure who made this, but I might have to stick above my desk because it’s the only way I seem to be able remember the difference between type 1 and type 2 error! <a href="https://t.co/bmk9DI30Jw">pic.twitter.com/bmk9DI30Jw</a></p>&mdash; Dr Ellen Grimås (@EllenGrimas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EllenGrimas/status/1171002176551956480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"  ></script>
        <p>
          But in order to quantify prevalences it's preferable that both errors compensate.
          Or making posterior adjustments if this unbalance is significant and can't be tuned.
        </p>
        <p>
          When undetected false negatives are not compensated with false positives there is <strong>misclasification bias</strong>, a kind of measure or information bias,
          depending on the taxonomy or scientific literature being consulted.
          Anyhow, independently of terminological considerations it should be adjusted in a similar way as other biases, like selection bias.
        </p>
      <p>
          Details of an applied <strong>statistical methodology</strong> to adjust a particular study similar to ENECOVID can be consulted on
          a

         <h6>What about ENECOVID methodology?</h6>
        <p>
          Regarding the Spain's ENE-Covid19 serosurvey, the report with preliminary results briefly describes its technical approach to compensate for selection bias:

      <p>Furthermore an adjustment method to compensate possible misclassification bias due to test errors, similar to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/suppl/2020/04/17/2020.04.14.20062463.DC1/2020.04.14.20062463-1.pdf">Santa Clara's statistical approach</a>, is also detailed
        in Annex 3 of <a href="https://portalcne.isciii.es/enecovid19/documentos/ene_covid19_dis.pdf">ENECOVID study design</a>
      </p>

      <br/>
        <p>
        However the report with preliminary results warns that results are provisional because of the lack of combination with immunoassay.
        And also mentions in future tense that the combination of rapid tests and immunoassay will correct the minor sensitivity of the former
        with the results of the latter to maximize the representativity and the information quality.
      </p>

        <br/>
        <p>
          So I assume according to this claim that adjustment on sensitivity was not yet applied, and I'll try to infer in a simplified way how we could approximate the
          adjusted seroprevalence according to the current provided numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
        According to the report, rapid tests Orient GeneIgM/IgG were used, from company ZhejiangOrient Gene Biotech. Due to the difficulty of reading IgM band all the results refer to IgG.
        Manufacturer-reported sensitivity and specificity for serological detection of IgG is 97% and 100%. But these values are probably too optimistic.
        Reliability studies performed by ENE-COVID19 documented 79% sensitivity and 100% specificity for IgG.

      </p>
      <figure>
      <img src="img/seroprevalence_and_bias_2.png" alt="Seroprevalence methodology. Estimated specificity and sensitivity of rapid tests" style="border:1px solid black">

      </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br/>
      <p>Annex 1 of study design provides more detail on these reliability studies. So we know 150 PCR samples were used to evaluate the rapid test, being 97 PCR+ and 53 PCR-.
      Under this benchmark global sensitivity for IgG+ was 79.4% and specificity 100%. But due to the small size of evaluated test samples
      we could provide
      more conservative estimations. For specificity our uncertainty margin could be in the interval <math><mtext>[98.1% (=53/54), 100%]</mtext></math>.
      Whereas for sensitivity we could infer that 77 true positives were detected by IgG,
      <!--so the uncertainty margin would be <math>[78.6% (=77/98), 80.4% (=78/97)]</math>,-->
      and we could estimate also a
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661219/figure/F3/">95% confidence interval</a> of <math><mtext>[71.4%, 87.4%]</mtext></math>.

      </figure>
      <br/>
      <h6>Assumptions: 100% specificity, lower sensitivity</h6>
      <p>
        With 100% specificity there would be no false positives.
        And with sensitivity of 79%, for a prevalence of 5% there would be 5% of true positives and approximately 1.3% <math><mtext>(= 0.21 x 0.05 / 0.79)</mtext></math> of false negatives.
        So seroprevalence should rise to 6.3%.
        but slightly higher than preliminary 5% estimate, and also not bounded to the provided 95% confidence interval of 4.7% and 5.4%.
        </p>
        <p>I've detailed the calculation with intermediate steps on false positives and false negatives estimations. But we could use directly the expression from the previous annex:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center">
        <math>
        <mtext>
          Prevalence* = (Prevalence - (1 - Specificity)) / (Sensitivity - (1 - Specificity)) = 0.05 / 0.79 = 6.3%
        </mtext>
        </math>
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, the study refers to coherence between immunoassay, considered as "ground truth", and IgG rapid test results,
          being 97.3% for 16953 analysed samples. But... if "ground truth" was 100% reliable, specificity for IgG was 100%
           and prevalence less than 5.4% then sould be 94.6% of true negatives perfectly detected.
           So for the reminder 4.7% to 5.4% the accuracy of IgG rapid test would be approximately
          between 50% <math><mtext>(= (0.973 - 0.946) / 0.054)</mtext></math> and 42.6%
          <math><mtext>(= (0.973 - 0.953) / 0.047)</mtext></math>.
        </p>
        <p>In the worst case, considering the more pessimistic sensitivity for IgG being only 42.6%, or rounding down, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/03/douglas-adams-42-hitchhiker?INTCMP=SRCH">42</a>%,
          which is unlikely, false negatives could approximate to 6.9% <!--(= 0.58 x 0.05 / 0.42),-->
          and estimated seroprevalence would rise to near 12%.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, from 247 participants with PCR+, IgG antibodies were detected on 83% <math><mtext>(76.2 - 88.2 IC 95%)</mtext></math>, as presented in the next table.
        </p>
        <figure>

        <br/>
      <p>
          Assuming 100% reliability on PCR+ and 100% specificity of rapid test, IgG sensitivity could be on the interval between 76.2% and 88.2%.
          For the higher bound, 88.2%, false negatives could approximate to 0.7%
          <!--(=0.118 x 0.05 / 0.882)-->
          and seroprevalence would be around 5.7%.
        </p>

        <p>
          Considering even the most optimistic scenario with 100% specificity and 97% sensitivity reported by the manufacturer,
          false negatives could approximate to 0.1% <!--(=0.03 x 0.05 / 0.97)-->.
          And 5.1% seroprevalence would be in the current provided 95% Interval of Confidence <math><mtext>(4.7%, 5.4%)</mtext></math>.
          However, with analogous calculation, if sensitivity was lower than 92%,
          seroprevalence would rise above the current provided 5.4% upper bound.
        </p>
        <h6>Assumptions: 99% specificity, 79% sensitivity</h6>
        <p>All the previous calculations based on the assumption that specificity for IgG detection was truly 100%
          as manufacturer claims and reliability studies made for ENE-COVID seemingly registered. But what if this specificity was 99%, for instance?

          In this case, maintaining the assumption of 79% sensitivity, true positives would have been 4.1%
          with the remainder 0.9% bein false positives, and approximately 1.1% false negatives.
          So actual prevalence would be around 5.2%, between the margins of the provided 95% IC.
          Curiously, as previously said, a worse specificity, undesirable for clinical purposes, would produce
          better raw estimates of prevalence. As long as for each 20 false negatives due to low sensitivity
          we would get 1 false positive due to imperfect specificity.
          And boths effects would compensate each other for an expected prevalence near to 5%.

        <h6>Conclusions</h6>
        <p>While we wait for the immunoassays to be completed to "fine tune" the preliminary ENECOVID seroprevalence estimate,
          we could get some rules of thumb (or <i>cuentas de la vieja</i>) for the effects
          of expected test errors on the 5% provided average value.
          In particular, due to the relation between actual specificity and sensitivity for IgG detection
          with the rapid test Orient Gene Biotech.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>If sensitivity and specificity for IgG were 100% and 97% as reported by the manufacturer, there would be no significant misclasification bias</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, if these values approximate to those reported by reliability studies to ENECOVID, we could expect bias.
          Concretely, if sensitivity was 79%, false negative would rise the actual seroprevalence above the provided confidence interval margins.
          Unless this effect was compensated with posterior adjustment or specificity being closer to 99% instead of 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
           And particularly, <u>if specificity of rapid test was indeed 100% and sensitivity for IgG 79%, my (educated?) guess would be
             actual seroprevalence closer to 6.3%</u>. Additionally, a more conservative range of sensitivity estimates between (very pesimistic) 42% and (very optimistic) 97%,
             would broaden the interval of possible seroprevalence between 5.1% and 12%.
        </p>
        <p>The following chart is intended to represent adjusted seroprevalence estimates depending on the relation of specificity and sensitivity,
          for a baseline raw estimate of 5%

        <!--<figcaption><small>Adjusted seroprevalence estimates for different values of sensitivity and specificity.</small>
        </figcaption>
      -->
      <br/>

      <p>
      As a limitation of the previous analysis, all the calculations presented here have been applied assuming
      that specificity and sensitivity remain independent of sex, age or presence of symptoms.
      As it's not clear if this assumption is going to be fulfilled, <a href="https://portalcne.isciii.es/enecovid19/documentos/ene_covid19_dis.pdf">ENECOVID study design</a> refers to this issue in its
      Annex 3, describing how a proper adjustment should be done. First of all, the procedure should estimate both sensitivity and specificity
      at subgroups. Subsequently, the prevalence adjustment should be applied at subgroup level before results are promediated.
    </p>

        <p>In any case, despite this possible unadjusted bias, according to the previous (quick & dirty) calculations, actual average seroprevalence in Spain would be still far from remote possibility of "herd immunity",
          though it could affect to Infection Fatality Rate estimates, for instance. And as it was mentioned in the referred preliminary ENECOVID report,
          and also remarked here just a few paragraphs before,
          <u>this sensitivity/specificity bias is expected to be corrected in the next round of results by the combination of estimates from immunoassay</u>.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Confirmed cases vs. estimates of actual infections (Updated 5/04/2020)</div>
            <p> <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> are only a (generally small and biased) subsample of actual infections.

              How small and how biased?
              It depends on the <strong>testing</strong> resources and protocols applied in each country/region.
            </p>

          <p>
            How many people could be actually infected all around?
            Estimations have been done by different models and analysts.
            For instance, the following values have been reported by the
            <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-04-03-COVID19-Report-14.pdf">

          </a>
        </p>
          <p>
          According to this model, Spain could have around 15% of infected population as of March 28th.
          But the 95% credible interval provided was between 3.7% and 41%. So the <strong>uncertainty</strong> is still huge!
          However, even the lower bound of the estimation corresponded to almost 2 million people.
          Almost 30 times higher than the number of confirmed cases in Spain at that date (72K).
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kikollan">Kiko Llaneras</a> et al also published at

          4 different calculations, from different researchers and models, ranging from 150K to 900K expected infections

          While the estimations of Imperial College have been broadly communicated in mass media, often ignoring
          the main <strong>assumptions</strong> and confidence intervals underlying the gross numbers,
          I think data team at <i>elpais.com</i>, and specially Llaneras is doing a god job on communicating the numbers
          but also contextualizing assumptions under these numbers.
        </p>
            <p>
              Anyhow, numbers from confirmed cases and notified deaths per country, and alternative
              <strong>estimates</strong> of actual infections and deaths
              infered by different studies and models
              should be understood under their <strong>context</strong>.
              Language should be used rigourously to avoid <i>misinformation</i>.

              <p>
                Moreover the number of confirmed and notified deaths is also an estimation of actual deaths caused by the virus.
                And specially in some countries/regions this value could be highly underestimated.
                Statistics on mortality monitoring on all causes, as project <a href="https://www.euromomo.eu">EuroMomo</a> does,
                can be useful to infer alternative (and better) estimates based on excess mortality.
                This project was launched in 2008 and it uses data from a network of 29 partner Institutes from 26 countries.
                They have accessible maps with weekly estimated deviations from the baseline
                (<a href="https://www.euromomo.eu/outputs/images/z-score_lightbox.fw.png">z-scores</a>)
                 from week 1 of 2010 up until today. And charts with disaggregated <a href="https://www.euromomo.eu/outputs/zscore_country_total.html">
                data by country and age range</a> for the past 4½ years.

              <p>Despite the dramatic situation in many places, differences are still huge even for regions in the same country.
                For instance, the following charts belong to the
                <a href="https://www.isciii.es/QueHacemos/Servicios/VigilanciaSaludPublicaRENAVE/EnfermedadesTransmisibles/MoMo/Documents/informesMoMo2020/MoMo_Situacion%20a%202%20de%20abril_CNE.pdf">

              </p>
              <p>
                We can observe excess mortality has been yet dramatically huge in the second figure representing the Region of Madrid.

                 However the third figure represents Canary Islands, where the first case in Spain was diagnosed.
                 And it shows the impact on mortality in this region has been much lower.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fortunately, after the hard confinement measures decreed by the Spanish Government,
                both regions have current estimations of Basic Reproduction Number (R0) at April 7th near or under 1.
                According to official
                <a href="https://portalcne.isciii.es/covid19/">estimates by the Spanish Ministry of Healthcare</a>,
                R0 estimates would be 0.99 for Madrid and 0.71 for the Canary Islands.
              </p>

              <p>MoMo project in Spain collects information of aproximately 4K civil registers,
                with a coverage of the 92% of the Spanish population. Estimates of expected mortality are based
                on historical averages of observed mortality since January 1th 2008 until one year before the current date.
                This information has been published in reports in PDF format. Buth they have recently developed also an
                <a href="https://momo.isciii.es/public/momo/dashboard/momo_dashboard.html">interactive dashboard</a>
                with access to historical <a href="https://momo.isciii.es/public/momo/dashboard/momo_dashboard.html#datos">

                Next figure published by <a href="https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020/04/09/actualidad/1586435286_092135.html">elpais</a>
                presents both the number of deaths registered by MoMo and deaths confirmed with COVID-19 until April 2th in
                the 17 regional autonomies of Spain.

<p>
  Despite this chart doesn't show the excess mortality estimates by MoMo, but the total number of deaths, we can
  see that confirmed COVID-19 deaths at april 2th in Madrid or Catalunya are even higher than the total number
  of deaths registered in these regions until April 7th. Whereas in Castilla y León and Castilla La Mancha,
  where high ratios of excess mortality have been detected, the reported COVID-19 deaths have been significantly lower.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Due to the <strong>latency</strong> in collecting this kind of data conclusions have to be read with <strong>caution</strong></i>.
  In some regions latency on notification would be higher than usual due to saturated Civil Registers.
Curiously, the excess mortality estimated by MoMo at April 5th (12940) approximates a lot the 12418 COVID-19
confirmed deaths at country level at the same date.
<!--If this trend consolidates, one possible hypothesis for underestimates and overestimates at region level
could be related with interregional demographics. Maybe many residents in Madrid originary from Castilla y Leon and Castilla La Mancha could have been registered
  as deaths in their regions of birth.-->

                It seems that COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) could be less lethal in relative terms than current figures we get in Italy or Spain
                (<i>estimated deaths/estimated infections</i> would be lower than <i>confirmed deaths/confirmed cases</i>).
                Though much more contagious than we expected. So <i>much more lethal in absolute terms</i>.
                With the aggravating circumstance of saturating healthcare systems

                April 4th report by CCAES</a> (Center of Alert Coordination and Healthcare Emergencies),

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Spain vs Germany (updated 26-04-2020)</div>

          <p>The number of confirmed cases in Germany at April 26th is around 157K people, whereas there are around 226K confirmed cases in Spain
            (<a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85320e2ea5424dfaaa75ae62e5c06e61">Johns Hopkins University</a>,
            <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">worldometer</a>). But relative lethality estimates by COVID-19 on Germany seems below 4% (<i>confirmed deaths / confirmed cases</i>). Much lower than figures in Spain (10%)
            or Italy (13%).
          </p>
          <p>

            There are several aspects than could explain this big difference.
            But I will focus on the representativity of the sample of confirmed tests in relation to the overall population.
            If we compare the distribution of confirmed cases by age groups in Spain and Germany we can see that:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
            In Spain confirmed cases are biased to ranges of older people. While young people would be underrepresented.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Germany we have just the opposite effect. Though their distribution of confirmed cases is more similar to the overall distribution, people from 60 to 79 would be slightly underrepresented, while age group of 35 to 59 would be overrepresented among confirmed cases.
          </li>
        </ul>

            At the begining of the crisis South Korea was the country with a higher number of tests performed
            and a more representative sample in terms of age distribution. Currently,
            according to Our World in Data, Iceland has performed much more tests per capita.
            Furthermore is a reference on <a href="https://www.covid.is/english">data transparency</a>.
            <iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?time=latest&country=ECU+EST+ISL+IND+IDN+ITA+NOR+SEN+SGP+ZAF+KOR+CHE+TWN+TUR+GBR+USA+VNM" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the number of confirmed cases and deaths with COVID-19 on Iceland,
            relative lethality for those tested positive could be below 1%.
            Actually at the time of writing is only around 0.5% in that country.
            Moreover, data from Iceland is helping to get more educated guesses on the proportion of asymptomatic infected people.
            Estimates published on April 14th on <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100">Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic Population</a>,
            report that "43% of the participants who tested positive reported having no symptoms, although symptoms almost certainly developed later in some of them.".
            Though these estimations have to be read also with caution as the effect of false positives should be taked into account.

            This <a href="https://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html?CFR=0.01&D_hospital_lag=5&D_incbation=5.2&D_infectious=10&D_recovery_mild=11.1&D_recovery_severe=28.6&I0=1&InterventionAmt=0.26&InterventionTime=94.4&P_SEVERE=0.2&R0=3.9&Time_to_death=32&logN=15.761420707019587">simulator</a> implements a classical infectious disease model:
            <i>SEIR (Susceptible → Exposed → Infected → Removed)</i> [<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext">Wu, et. al</a>, Kucharski et. al].
            The model uses 13 parameters, including <i>Mortality statistics</i> and the <i>Basic Reproduction Number (R0)</i> before and after the <i>Intervention</i> day.
</p>
<p>
I tried to adjust the evolution of confirmed deaths (<i>Fatalities</i>) in the Region of Madrid since the day this number was over N=10.
Displacing <i>Intervention</i> day relatively to this reference. And ignoring the <i>Day 0</i> as time origin.
<!--I expect that following trends of confirmed fatalities would propagate less uncertainty
and provide more reliable estimates than starting from the first confirmed case.-->
</p>

</a>
  <p> Concretely, the number of reported deaths on the Region of Madrid at 14th March, when the Spanish Government decreeted
    the state of Alarm, was 213. While only 7 days before, the number was 16. And 3 weeks later this number increased from 213 to
    5136, according to <a href="https://covid19.isciii.es/resources/serie_historica_acumulados.csv">covid19.iscii.es data</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I used 1% as <i>Mortality Statistics</i> and 10 days for <i>T<small>inf</small> (Duration patient is infectious)</i>.
    And in order to fit the evolution of confirmed deaths R0 was established to 3.9 before the intervention
    and 1.0 after the intervention.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think the model is useful to have an idea of the interconnected variables and effects.
    <!--And trying to fit the different parameters according to the last knowledge available.-->
    But results from this model should be read with caution.
    Moreover, appart from the uncertainty introduced by many different estimated parameters and hidden variables,
    this implementation of SEIR ignores the effect of the healthcare capacity system,
    and the possibility on mortality increase due to ICU bed shortage.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Techcrunch Disrupt Hackathon Berlin</div>
            <p>Could you get into a berlin exclusive nightclub?
              <strong>Berlout</strong> tells users if they fit the admission criteria for Berlin clubs:
              dark clothes, no jeans, no more than 3 people, around 30s, no laughing, no drinks...

              You only have to take a picture.
              And <i>computer vision</i> algorithm identifies elements related with your probability of being rejected.
              You will see what clubs you could enter with more chances according to this evaluation.
